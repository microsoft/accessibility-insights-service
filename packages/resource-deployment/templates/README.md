# Services dashboard

Time settings, including the overall time range and granularity of aggregations, can be changed in UTC time button in the top left.

### Dashboard tiles:

-   **Availability**
    -   (# Availability test failures) / (# Availability test runs)
    -   Availability tests are run every 5 minutes by the health-monitor-timer-func in web-workers. The test verifies that we can:
        1. Ping the health endpoint to check that the service is available
        2. Submit a scan request
        3. Get the status of the submitted scan request
        4. Get the scan report once the scan completes
    -   If any of these steps fails (either an http error code or an internal scan failure), an availability failure is sent. Otherwise, once all steps complete, an availability success is sent.
-   **Azure Services Availability**
    -   Availability of Cosmos and Storage account, using metrics provided by Azure.
-   **Reliability**
    -   (# Requests failed with 5xx status code) / (# Total requests)
    -   This is calculated using all requests, including those generated by our availability tests and user requests
-   **Node states**
    -   State of all nodes in batch pools. Can be used to check batch pool availability. (This is the same as the Node States graph on the batch account overview)
-   **API response code counts**
    -   Count of API response codes by category
-   **Total request count and average response time**
    -   Total number of API requests (across all endpoints) and average response time
    -   Per-endpoint request counts and response times are in different tiles
-   **Count of scan requests submitted**
    -   The total number of submitted scan requests, as well as how many were accepted or rejected (for invalid urls)
    -   Counts are aggregated over the set time granularity
-   **Count of scans completed**
    -   The total number of scans completed, as well as how many succeeded or failed
    -   Counts are aggregated over the set time granularity
    -   Note: If there are no failures for the given time range, ScanTaskFailure may not appear in the legend
-   **Scan duration (seconds)**
    -   scanExecutionTime: The amount of time it took for the scan to run (starting when the batch worker begins the scan)
    -   scanWaitTime: The time from when the scan was submitted to when the batch worker started the scan
    -   scanTotalTime: The time from when the scan was submitted to when the scan completed and the report became available (scanExecutionTime + scanWaitTime)
-   **Running batch pool tasks**
    -   Number of running pool tasks compared to the maximum number of allowed parallel tasks
-   **Average pool sampling interval (seconds)**
    -   Sampling interval used for polling batch tasks
-   **API request count**
    -   Total number of requests for each azure function (including web-workers) during the time range
-   **API response time**
    -   Average response time for each azure function (including web-workers) during the time range
-   **Failure requests by function name**
    -   Sum of failures by all azure functions (including web-workers) during the time range
    -   Failure counts are aggregated over the set time granularity
-   **Performance**
    -   Scan performance as a percentage of cases where the scanExecutionTime (see notes on Scan duration graph) did not exceed the target
