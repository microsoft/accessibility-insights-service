## Deployment

### Azure Resources

-   Follow this [README](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/blob/master/packages/resource-deployment/README.md) to deploy required Azure resources.

### Service Binaries

-   Under the **batch-pool-startup-script** Blob container upload following files from the [resource-deployment](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/resource-deployment) package:

    ```
        pool-startup.sh
    ```

-   Under the **batch-job-manager-script** Blob container upload following files from the [job-manager](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/job-manager) package build output:

    ```
        job-manager.js
        run-job-manager.sh
    ```

-   Under the **batch-scan-request-sender-script** Blob container upload following files from the [scan-request-sender](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/scan-request-sender) package build output:

    ```
        job-manager.js
        run-job-manager.sh
    ```

    ```

### Azure Batch Account

#### Setup _url-scan-schedule_ job schedule

-   Update the local copy of [env-var--az-batch-task-parameter.template.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/resource-deployment/batch-account/templates/env-var--az-batch-task-parameter.template.json) template file by adding the following data:

    ```
        ⋅ The SAS URL for each resource file under resourceFiles section
        ⋅ AZURE_COSMOS_DB_URL and AZURE_COSMOS_DB_KEY values
    ```

    The SAS URL can be generated from Azure portal blade under each file within Blob container.

-   Encode template file to base64 using provided [encoder tool](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/tools/json-compressor). Run the following command from the [tools/json-compressor](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/tools/json-compressor) package build output:

    ```
        node index.js --jsonFile env-var--az-batch-task-parameter.template.json
    ```

    Preserve the _env-var--az-batch-task-parameter.template.base64.txt_ output file for the next step.

-   Update the local copy of [url-scan-schedule.template.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/resource-deployment/batch-account/templates/url-scan-schedule.template.json) template file by adding the following data:

    ```
        ⋅ The SAS URL for each resource file under resourceFiles section
        ⋅ The values under commonEnvironmentSettings section. Set the value of
          AZ_BATCH_TASK_PARAMETER parameter to the base64 encoded string from
          the step above.
    ```

-   Login into Azure Batch account using Azure CLI:

    ```
        az batch account login --name <accountName> --resource-group <resourceGroup>
    ```

-   Deploy job schedule using Azure CLI:

    ```
        az batch job-schedule create --json-file ./url-scan-schedule.template.json
    ```

#### Setup _scan-req-schedule_ job schedule

-   Update the local copy of [scan-req-schedule.template.json](https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service/tree/master/packages/resource-deployment/batch-account/templates/scan-req-schedule.template.json) template file by adding the following data:

    ```
        ⋅ The SAS URL for each resource file under resourceFiles section
        ⋅ The values under commonEnvironmentSettings section
    ```

-   Login into Azure Batch account using Azure CLI (if not done previously):

    ```
        az batch account login --name <accountName> --resource-group <resourceGroup>
    ```

-   Deploy job schedule using Azure CLI:

    ```
        az batch job-schedule create --json-file ./scan-req-schedule.template.json
    ```
