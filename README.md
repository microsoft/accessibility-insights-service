# Accessibility Insights Service

## Building the code

### 1. Clone the repository

-   Clone the repository using one of the following commands
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/accessibility-insights-service.git
    ```
-   Select the created directory
    ```bash
    cd accessibility-insights-service
    ```

### 2. Install Azure Function core tools

-   Follow the instructions in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local to install azure cli tools for building, running & deploying azure functions

### 3. Install packages

-   Install the packages
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 4. Create dev.DockerFile file for local deployment

-   Create dev.DockerFile under src\scanner\dev-docker from the dev.template.DockerFile which is under the same folder. **DO NOT checkin this file**.
    -   From src\scanner\dev-docker, clone dev.template.DockerFile & rename it to dev.DockerFile under the same directory.
    -   Get the secrets mentioned in the json from azure portal.
        -   For eg, AzureWebJobsStorage, go to the storage account you want to use in portal.
        -   Click on access keys from the left tab.
        -   Copy one of the connection strings.
        -   Paste it as the value for AzureWebJobsStorage in the local.settings.json

### 5. Build & deploy locally from vscode

-   Open workspace.code-workspace from .vscode\ folder under root directory.
-   On opening the workspace, it will suggest you to install the recommended extensions. Install them.
-   Go to a azure function project (eg, scanner) & open a file, say index.ts
-   Execute "Attach to JavaScript Functions" launch task. This build the project & deploys azure function locally.
    You can do this by either of the below two options.
    -   Press F5. (Make sure the correct launch task is selected from the drop down that appears).
    -   Or Press Ctrl+P and then type "debug" followed by space ' '. And then select "Attach to JavaScript Functions" from the list that appears.
-   Perform trigger operation to trigger an azure function. For eg, create a message in scan-url-queue azure queue to trigger scan-url function

### 6. Build & deploy locally from command line

-   Build project

    ```bash
       npm run build
    ```

-   Build container image

    ```bash
      npm run build-image
    ```

-   Deploy locally (goto the function folder you want to deploy. in this case, scanner function project is used)

    ```bash
       npm run run-func
    ```

-   Perform trigger operations for the corresponding azure function. For eg, create a message in scan-url-queue azure queue to trigger scan-url function

### 7. Commands to run before check in

-   Run the below command to build, test, check file format styling & tslint issues
    ```bash
    npm run precheckin
    ```
-   If the above command failed for formatting issues, run the below command to format all files
    ```bash
    npm run format
    ```

### 8. Build & deploy to production

-   If you already have azure function created in azure & have container registry setup, go to last two steps.
-   Create the azure function you are trying to deploy to. Refer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-create-function-linux-custom-image
    for more information on how to create the azure function.
    Set AzureWebJobsStorage setting as the storage account connection string under App Settings of your Azure function.
-   Create a Container registry in your azure subscription. Refer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/ for more information.
-   Build & deploy Docker image

    ```bash
       npm run deploy-prod

    ```

## Testing

### 1. Run Unit tests from command line

-   Run the below command
    ```bash
          npm test
    ```

### 2. Run current test file from vscode

-   Execute "Debug current unit test file" launch task. This build the project & deploys azure function locally.
    You can do this by either of the below two options.

    -   Press F5. (Make sure the correct launch task is selected from the drop down that appears).
    -   Or Press Ctrl+P and then type "debug" followed by space ' '. And then select "Debug current unit test file" from the list that appears.

### 3. Run test in watch mode

-   You can run tests whenever source code is modified in watch mode.

    ```bash
          npm run watch:test
    ```
